One nice thing about Gitlab is that you can use a regular expression (regex) to force consistency in your branch names. You can also provide merge request (MR, a.k.a. pull requests in GitHub) templates to prompt users to enter information about what they’re trying to merge into development. But there’s no built-in way to enforce consistency in the merge request titles. Until now!

For some background, the team at HourWork was trying to build out some tooling to help automate our change logs and reporting. Part of this effort involved parsing issues from MR titles. However, we needed to ensure consistent usage of the same title format to avoid missing any issues in the tooling. After looking at the Gitlab API and Gitlab Runner documentation, I found that I could do everything I needed in just a Gitlab CI snippet.

## The Snippet:

```yaml{numberLines: true}
mr-check:
  stage: test
  cache: []
  variables:
    DEFAULT_REGEX: '(Draft:\s)?(\[(#\d+|🔥|🔧|⭕|:fire:|:tools:|:o:)(, \#\d+)*\]|(\d{4}\.\d{2}\.\d{2}))\s[^"]+'
    DEFAULT_MESSAGE: 'Your MR does not have a valid title. Merge request titles should start with [\#ticketNum] or [\#ticket1, \#ticket2], or one of [🔥|🔧|⭕]. Please update the ticket title and rerun this job.'
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" && $IS_DEPLOYED_BRANCH != "true"
  before_script:
    - if [[ -z "$TITLE_REGEX" ]]; then TITLE_REGEX=$(echo $DEFAULT_REGEX); fi
    - INTERNAL_REGEX=$(echo "\"title\":\"$TITLE_REGEX\"")
    - if [[ -z "$TITLE_MESSAGE" ]]; then TITLE_MESSAGE=$(echo $DEFAULT_MESSAGE); fi
    - INTERNAL_MESSAGE=$(echo "$TITLE_MESSAGE")
  script:
    - >-
      MR=$(
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID"
      )
    - echo $MR | grep -P "$INTERNAL_REGEX" -o || EXIT_CODE=$?
    - >-
      if [[ -n "$EXIT_CODE" ]]; then curl -X POST -d "body=$INTERNAL_MESSAGE" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID/notes" && exit 1; fi
```

## Breaking it down

If you’re unfamiliar with Gitlab’s YAML CI format, check out their [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/). The snippet also assumes you have a rudimentary understanding of bash scripting

```yaml{numberLines: true}
mr-check:
  stage: .pre
  cache: []
```

This names the job `mr-check`, defines the job in the special `.pre` stage that runs before any other user-defined jobs, and tells the script to skip restoring any caches, as they won’t be needed here. If you’re not using Gitlab CI’s caching mechanism (which you probably should be if you’re downloading NPM packages, etc.), you can omit this line.

```yaml{numberLines: 4}
variables:
    DEFAULT_REGEX: '(Draft:\s)?(\[(#\d+|🔥|🔧|⭕|:fire:|:tools:|:o:)(, \#\d+)*\]|(\d{4}\.\d{2}\.\d{2}))\s[^"]+'
    DEFAULT_MESSAGE: 'Your MR does not have a valid title. Merge request titles should start with [\#ticketNum] or [\#ticket1, \#ticket2], or one of [🔥|🔧|⭕]. Please update the ticket title and rerun this job.'
```

This section defines the default variables for the job. The 'DEFAULT_REGEX' specifies the title-matching regex. This is a default value that can be overridden per project by specifying a different value for "TITLE_REGEX". In the default case, it is looking for an MR title that starts with one or more ticket number in square brackets (e.g. [#123] or [#123, #456]) followed by some brief description of the MR. We also have escape hatches for MRs that don’t have tickets, like 🔥for hotfixes or 🔧for chores. Finally we have a special title format for environment-to-environment MRs that start with today’s date (e.g. 2024.05.10). The DEFAULT_MESSAGE is what is sent to the user if the title doesn’t match the supplied regex.

```yaml{numberLines: 7}
 rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" && $IS_DEPLOYED_BRANCH != "true"
```

This line defines when the job runs. We only want to run this job if the pipeline source is “merge_request_event” which means our job was triggered by the creation of, or pushing to, an MR.

```yaml{numberLines: 9}
before_script:
    - if [[ -z "$TITLE_REGEX" ]]; then TITLE_REGEX=$(echo $DEFAULT_REGEX); fi
    - INTERNAL_REGEX=$(echo "\"title\":\"$TITLE_REGEX\"")
    - if [[ -z "$TITLE_MESSAGE" ]]; then TITLE_MESSAGE=$(echo $DEFAULT_MESSAGE); fi
    - INTERNAL_MESSAGE=$(echo "$TITLE_MESSAGE")
```

This sets up the regex we will use to pull the title information out of the Gitlab API response. The API call returns a JSON object containing all the relevant information about the MR. In this case we’re just interested in the value of the “title” field, so we need to set up a regex to pull just the title out. In the before_script, we check to see if the project has a defined “TITLE_REGEX” for that specific project, otherwise we use the “DEFAULT_REGEX” to create a new regex called “INTERNAL_REGEX” to look for the title match in the API response. We then do a similar thing with setting the message to be sent to the user if an override “TITLE_MESSAGE” is passed.

```yaml{numberLines: 14}
 script:
    - >-
      MR=$(
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID"
      )
```

Now for the meat of the script. First, we need to get the Gitlab API response for the contents of this MR. We use pre-defined Gitlab runner variables to setup our curl request: $CI_API_V4_URL contains the root of the URL for the API, $CI_PROJECT_ID is the current project’s Gitlab id, and $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID is the internal id of the project (i.e. within that specific project, not Gitlab globally - notice the second “I”). We also need to define a project or group CI variable called $GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN that contains a project or group access token (Settings -> Access Tokens). Make sure the token has the `api` scope so that it can read and write to the API. We store the response from the API in a variable called “MR”.

```yaml{numberLines: 19}
 - echo $MR | grep -P "$INTERNAL_REGEX" -o || EXIT_CODE=$?
    - >-
     if [[ -n "$EXIT_CODE" ]]; then curl -X POST -d "body=$INTERNAL_MESSAGE" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$CI_API_V4_URL/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/merge_requests/$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID/notes" && exit 1; fi
```

Next we use our regex to test the MR variable to see if there is a match using `grep`. If there is not a match, we store the exit code from `grep` in the variable “EXIT_CODE”. If “EXIT_CODE” has length > 0, we use the Gitlab API to add a note to the MR prompting the user to update the title of the MR to match the convention. Finally, we exit the job with a non-zero exit code, which means the job and pipeline fails so the MR cannot be merged until the error is fixed (assuming you require pipelines to pass before merging, which of course you do, right?).

## Usage

Save this script as `mr-check.yml` (or whatever you want to call it) somewhere within the group you want to use it in. We created a special "Gitlab Helpers" repo to store all of our shared Gitlab resources but this is optional. Once you have it saved, add the script to the include section of your project’s .gitlab-ci.yml file like so:

```yaml{numberLines: true}
include:
  - project: '<parent_group>/<subgroup>/<name_of_repo>'
    ref: 'main'
    file: 'ci-templates/mr-check.yml'
```

In this snippet, project is the full path to the repo where the snippet is stored (you may have 0+ subgroups in the example above, depending on your organization’s Gitlab setup). The ref is the commit/branch you want to use; in my case `main` is the default branch. Finally file is the path to the .yml file containing your mr-check snippet.

Alternatively, if you just want to use this in one project, you could always just copy the `mr-check` snippet into your .gitlab-ci.yml file directly. You could also edit the default variables and just use those directly without overriding them in your jobs.

And that’s it! Now when you create a new MR, the merge request pipeline will first create a job called `mr-check` that will verify that your title matches the regex you provided. If so the job passes and the pipeline continues; if not, the job fails and you get a note telling you what you need to do to fix it.

## Future work

Now you have a script that can run every time you create a new MR in Gitlab! From here we could add additional checks to the body, or tags, or anything else that we have programmatic access to via the Gitlab API. You could add a check for an unchecked checkbox in a MR template, or use a similar regex to look for linked issues. Anything that would help make your software process more robust you can add to this script.
