> I wanted an easier way to keep track of my progress through the Naturalist role in Red Dead Redemption Online, so I built this tracker application in React and deployed it to Amplify. It uses the LocalStorage API to keep track of your progress locally between sessions - no accounts or databases needed. This was a lot of fun and a really simple project to work on.
